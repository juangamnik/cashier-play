# Cashier Play

A **simple yet professional toy** application that simulates a digital cash register using an Express.js backend and a vanilla JavaScript web app. This project was developed incrementally following agile principles, with Johannes Neubauer as the Product Owner and ChatGPT as the developer. It is not a real cash register and does not meet security requirements like TSE. Instead, it is a tool for experimentation and learning, designed to work with common peripherals like ESC/POS 80mm receipt printers and barcode scanners.

More details about the implementation can be found on [Johannes' blog](https://www.kingsware.de).

## Features

- **Client-Server Architecture**: The client (web app) interacts with the server for operations like handling purchases and printing receipts.
- **Peripheral Integration**: 
  - Compatible with 80mm ESC/POS receipt printers for professional receipt printing.
  - Use any standard barcode scanner for item input.
- **Web-based Interface**: Accessible from any device with a browser, enabling flexible setups in stores or restaurants.

## Limitations

- **Not a Real Cash Register**: This application is not compliant with legal requirements (e.g., TSE in Germany) and is intended solely for educational and experimental purposes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (16.x or later recommended)
- An ESC/POS 80mm receipt printer
- A barcode scanner
- A device with a modern web browser for client access

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cashier-play
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Connect your ESC/POS printer to the server device.

## Usage

1. **Start the Server**:
   - In development mode (with live reload):
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - In production mode:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

2. **Access the Client**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to the server's URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

3. **Simulate a Transaction**:
   - Use the web app to input items using a barcode scanner or manual entry.
   - Complete the purchase and send the receipt to the connected printer.

## Project Structure

- **`server.js`**: Main entry point for the Express server.
- **Backend**:
  - Handles item data and manages receipt generation.
  - Communicates with the printer for ESC/POS output.
- **Frontend**:
  - Vanilla JavaScript application served from the server.
  - Provides a user-friendly interface for managing transactions.

## Development

- Use `nodemon` for live-reloading during development:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

## Dependencies

- **Express.js**: Server framework.
- **SQLite3**: Lightweight database for storing transaction data.
- **Body-parser**: Middleware for handling JSON requests.
- **Express-fileupload**: For handling file uploads (if needed).
- **jsdom** and **puppeteer**: Useful for server-side DOM manipulations and testing.
- **serve-index**: For directory listing in development.

## Usage of the Application

The application operates in **three distinct modes**, each designed for specific tasks during the simulation of a transaction. The active mode is visually indicated by a **purple border** around the corresponding section of the user interface.

### Modes

1. **NUMPAD: Adding Items**
   - **Purpose**: Use this mode to manually enter items into the shopping list or transaction.
   - **How to Use**:
     - Enter the item's code or details using the on-screen numeric keypad or an attached barcode scanner.
     - Confirm the input to add the item to the current transaction.
   - **Visual Cue**: The NUMPAD section is highlighted with a purple border.

2. **SEARCH: Filtering the Item List**
   - **Purpose**: Quickly find specific items from the list by searching for their name or partial details.
   - **How to Use**:
     - Type the desired item name, code, or keyword into the search bar.
     - The item list will dynamically filter to display matching results.
     - Select an item to view or add it to the transaction.
   - **Visual Cue**: The SEARCH section is highlighted with a purple border.

3. **MENU: Choosing the Shop and Item List**
   - **Purpose**: Switch between different shops or scenarios (e.g., Restaurant, Discounter, Zoohandel) to load the appropriate item list.
   - **How to Use**:
     - Navigate to the MENU mode.
     - Select the desired shop type from the available options.
     - The item list and other settings will update based on the chosen shop scenario.
   - **Visual Cue**: The MENU section is highlighted with a purple border.

### Workflow Example

1. Start by selecting a **shop** in the **MENU** mode to load the relevant item list.
2. Switch to **NUMPAD** mode to add items to the transaction via manual entry or barcode scanner.
3. Use the **SEARCH** mode at any time to quickly locate specific items in the list.
4. Complete the transaction by finalizing the list, and print the receipt via the server.

### Notes

- Switching between modes is seamless and ensures efficient handling of transactions.
- The design ensures flexibility for various setups, whether in a retail store, restaurant, or other environments.

<img width="1500" alt="Articles View" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1ee24b3-854d-4a73-8edd-fd15b27ed8eb" />

The application provides a **dedicated print view** for each shop or business type, accessible under the route `business/<shop-name>`. This feature is designed to display a comprehensive, printer-friendly list of items available in the selected shop. The view is optimized for clarity and readability, making it ideal for physical distribution or for use during inventory management.

### Layout Description

1. **Header**:
   - The top of the page prominently displays the **shop name** (e.g., "Discounter").
   - A small ASCII representation of a receipt icon is included for visual context.

2. **Item Table**:
   - The main section features a structured table with the following columns:
     - **Item Number**: The unique identifier for each product. This is represented both as a number and as a scannable **barcode** for compatibility with barcode scanners.
     - **Name**: The product name, grouped under categories (e.g., "BAKERY") for better organization.
     - **Price**: The price per unit of the product, formatted in the local currency (e.g., EUR).
     - **Vat**: Indicates the applicable tax category (e.g., "B").

3. **Barcodes**:
